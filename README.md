# Bike Buyers Analysis

### Project Overview
The Bike Buyer Dataset Analysis project aims to explore the relationship between customer demographics and their likelihood to purchase bikes. 
The dataset includes critical factors such as income, education, and occupation, as well as lifestyle aspects like home ownership, commute distance, and car ownership. 
By analyzing these variables, the project seeks to provide data-driven insights that can help businesses make informed decisions regarding their bike sales strategies.

### Data Source 
This project is based on a dataset provided by Alex the Analyst as part of his YouTube tutorial titled "Full Excel Project for Beginners". 
The dataset was used to practice and showcase my skills in data analysis, including data cleaning, formatting, and extracting insights using Microsoft Excel.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks: 
- Removed Duplicates: Identified and removed any duplicate entries.
- Formatted Data: Standardized the data to ensure consistency, particularly with the "Age Bracket" column.
- Handled Missing Values: Addressed any missing or inconsistent data to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. What is the income distribution of customers who purchased bikes compared to those who did not?
2. Does age influence the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
3. Do people with shorter or longer commute distances show more interest in buying bikes?
4. What factor are most correlated with a bike purchased?
